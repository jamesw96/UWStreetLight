Step 0. 
Use Webpack to get the file into Server  [Webpack 2.0]
Install Module using npm (node ecosystem) [Node 6.9]
Webpack configuration
Bundler

Step 1. 
OSM Data find Layer street (vector tile format)

Step 2. 
Use script to convert back to geoJson

Step 3. 
Use (Turf) GIS tool, do some math-y stuff to it
Find intersection of circle and street, then calculate percentage 
When calculate line use Haversine function!
When drawing buffer for circle use bufferpoint.js

Step 4. 
Add new layer and style


Note:
Use require [var path = require('path');, var webpack = require('webpack');] --> Import is more consistent (better than require) [But start with require]
[var turf = require('turf')]
